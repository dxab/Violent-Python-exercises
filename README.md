# Violent-Python-exercises
Violent Python exercises. These are my own takes on the programming exercises on VP, not just copypastas from the included code in the book
They are my own interpretation from Violent Python's in text examples. The exercises are made under the same parameters that the 
chapters illustrate, however they are made with minimal input from the book so that I have to conduct independent research (thank you stackoverflow) and actively learn/be involved in finding solutions.
