# Violent-Python-exercises
Violent Python exercises. These are my own takes on the programming exercises on VP, not just copypastas from the included code in the book
cryptcracker.py is my own interpretation from Ch1 on Violent Python's crypt() cracker example. The cracker was made under the same concept that the 
chapter illustrated.
